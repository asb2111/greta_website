As a pediatric registered dietitian-nutritionist with over 10 years of experience, I’ve always advocated for quality sleep for the families I work with. Then in 2019 when my twins were born, I came to know first-hand just how challenging it can be to get a good night’s rest. 

I completed the intensive Sleep Coach Training program with Little Dipper Wellness in August 2023 and now provide comprehensive sleep coaching services for parents of babies and toddlers ages 0-4. 

Please reach out today set up a complimentary 15-minute discovery call to learn how I can help you and your child/children get a better night’s rest. I look forward to connecting with you!
