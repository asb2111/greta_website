## Greta Breskin, MS, RD, LDN, CSP (she/her)
Hello! My name is Greta Breskin and I am a Registered Dietitian and a Board-Certified Specialist in Pediatric Nutrition. 

I completed my master’s degree in nutrition education and dietetic internship at Columbia University in New York City in 2013. Shortly after moving to North Carolina in 2015, I joined the clinical nutrition team at UNC Children’s Hospital in Chapel Hill, where I cared for newborns through young adults with a variety of common and rare medical conditions. I spent four of my seven years at UNC in the outpatient Children’s Specialty Clinics specializing in the nutrition care of children with feeding difficulties and gastrointestinal diseases. I have expert knowledge of and experience with dietary therapies for pediatric Crohn’s disease.

My professional passion for counseling families was strengthened by my lived experience parenting twins. In 2022 I left my role at the UNC Hospital system to work in private practice pediatric nutrition counseling. If you are struggling with feeding your child, you are not alone, and I can help!

I provide nutrition assessment and counseling for infants, children, and adolescents through FuelNC Nutrition. I apply nutrition interventions and feeding frameworks backed by scientific literature to help each family I work with achieve their goals. 

To supplement my knowledge of nutrition, I completed evidenced-based sleep education courses. I integrate these concepts into my nutrition counseling work when relevant. I also provide comprehensive sleep coaching services through Little Dipper Sleep.
