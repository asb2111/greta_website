I provide nutrition counseling (also known as medical nutrition therapy) for families of babies, kids, and teens ages 0-20 years. I am in-network with BCBS (including NC State Health Plan), Aetna, Cigna, and United Healthcare. I also accept private pay.

I can support you with nutrition counseling related to your child’s:

- Selective eating
- Food allergies 
- Gastrointestinal disease
- Diet therapy for Crohn’s disease
- Infant feeding
- Growth or weight concerns
- Other nutrition concerns

I strive to provide inclusive, non-judgmental, and evidenced-based care to all my patients and families. Please reach out today to set up a complimentary 15-minute discovery call. I look forward to connecting with you!
